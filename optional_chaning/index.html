            Optional Chaining

    The optional chaining ?. is a safe way to access nested object properties,
        even if an intermediate property doesn't exist.

    The optional chaining ?. stops the evaluation if the value before ?. is 
        undefined or null and returns undefined.

Optional Chaining with function - getName?.()


DO NOT OVERUSE the OPTIONAL CHAINING

We should use ?. only where it is ok that something doesn't exist.

For Example, if according to our coding logic user object must exist, but address is optional,
            then we should write user.address?.street , 
            but not user?.address?.street.

    So,if user happens to be undefined due to a mistake, we will see a programming 
            error about it and fix it.

        Otherwise, coding errors can be silenced where not appropriate 
        and become more difficult to debug.
