        CALL BY REFERENCE  ---  SHALLOW COPY  ----  MUTABLE OBJECT 

        CALL BY VALUE ---- DEEP COPY ---   IMMUTABLE OBJECT 

        Primitive Type - number, boolean, string , null , undefined - immutable - deep copy only

        Shallow Copy -  when we make a copy of original variable into another variable(copied) by 
                        using assignment operator(=) that time only the reference address of original 
                        variable is copied into another variable instead of original values 

                        So at last both variables refer to the same value. So when we make any changes 
                        in new variable if will also mutable or change the original variable.

        Deep Copy - it is also identified by pass by Value, when we make a copy of variable into another 
                    variable by using assignment operator at that time all the values(object, array )
                    along with reference address of original variable is copied into another variable.

                    At last, both variables refer to different referenced values. So when we make change
                    in new variable it won't mutable the original variable.

        json.strigyfy() is not capable to copy if function is there in the object
